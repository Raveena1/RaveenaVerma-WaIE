### This project is based on MVVM and Repository Design pattern.
## Kotlin + MVVM + Repository Pattern + Retrofit for Network API Call to get NASA APOD Data + Kotlin Coroutine  

### This Project is just to show Astronomical Image of the day with the title and explanation. Used NASA Open API's to get data using Retrofit
### Instructions to run the code
### Latest Version of Android Studio is required and update all Build and platform tools.

### Improvement Areas :
### Unit Test cases can be written
### When First time user launch App without Internet, we can have a default Astronomical Photo image but that was not clear requirement. 
### More Interactive UI can be made.
## Changes can be made for image data to be load as normal image as currently I have used, "hdUrl" field which may take more time to load
## depends on Internet connection
## Debugging Logs can be added to Debug the code
